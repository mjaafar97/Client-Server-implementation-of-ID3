# Client-Server-implementation-of-ID3
The client takes the raw user data including the age , gender, occupation , movie production year, and movie genres(s). 
Then the client processes this data to send it to the server in a form of a string that has all the data encoded in it.
The server has the trained ID3 model. It takes the user input and produces an output that is 0 if the rating is 1 , 2
predicting that the user will not like the movie and the output is 1 if the rating is 4 , or 5 predicting the user will like the movie.
